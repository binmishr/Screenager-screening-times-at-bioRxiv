A Brief Introduction
======================

When a preprint is uploaded to bioRxiv, it undergoes screening before it appears online. How long does it take for Affiliates to screen preprints at bioRxiv?

tl;dr I used R to look at bioRxiv screening times. Even though bioRxiv has expanded massively, screening happens quickly (in about 24 h).

I am a bioRxiv Affiliate – one of the people who does the screening. Preprints wait in a queue to be screened. Over the years, I’ve seen the typical queue get longer and longer. In the early days the queue was maybe 10 preprints. These days it’s often over 100.

It’s a team effort and more Affiliates have been recruited over time. Yet I often wonder how we’re doing. My impression is that there are always lots of Neuroscience and Bioinformatics papers in queue. Do any subject areas get neglected? If so, should Affiliates in these areas be recruited specifically?
